## How do you get a city?
You can gradually "buy" your city in 100 x 100 fields. A 100 x 100 field will cost you a one-time 100,000 Minegeld, and the first field has to be at least 300 meters from another city border. Then, when a city spreads directly to another city, that must be clarified with the others city owner. The maximum allowed unbuilt fields are only 2 100 x 100 fields. (For a field to be built, the city owner has to be able to show at least one property sold to a player in the field).

## Land sale:
When selling land, 40% of the purchase price goes to the state. Such land sales must be reported to the state, otherwise penalties may be imposed. Once a property has been sold, it can only be expropriated if the player is inactive for more than 3 months. As a city owner, you are allowed to determine what may be built on the property and how it may be used. This has to be clearly defined at the time of sale in a contract.

Only in one city may a property be sublet for money (this must be clarified with the city owner (for hotels, shops, etc.)).

## expropriation:
If a player is inactive for more than 3 months, the city is expropriated and falls into the hands of the state. The city will then be auctioned immediately. If no buyer is found, the city is dissolved. The owners of the properties remain preserved. The only thing: the area is no longer considered as a city.

## server facilities.
It is also possible to build, for example, adminshops, police stations or other server-specific facilities in cities. But that's what the server team decides. However, inquiries can be made.

## Imaginations:
Each city also likes to get a page here to introduce themselves, and to give their benefits.
