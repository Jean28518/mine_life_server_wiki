A player is considered inactive if he has not been on the server for 3 months. This can be tracked with `/last-login <SpierlerName>`.

If a player is inactive, he is no longer rights to his property. You as a player are welcome to report the property of an inactive player, and if it is not a great structure, the property with all the chests will be removed.

If it is a great structure, then the ownership passes to the server. Maybe it will then be auctioned, or simply immortalized on the server. But that will be the decision of the server team ;)
