The railroad plays an important role on the server because you should not be able to teleport normally. You can apply for a railway line by calling on a railway employee or the team. For example, if you have a city in planning, you can even build a suburban train, or a whole main station, to get more people into your city. Rail lines can usually only run double track, and only the construction of a railway line costs money. Railway lines are usually built above ground.

## Prices:

** Basic fee: ** 20,000 coins

| | Above ground: | Underground / Tunnel: | Bridge: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ** per 100 m route: ** | 5,000 | 10,000 | 7,000 |
| ** per station: ** | 10,000 | 20,000 | 15,000 |

Due to RPG elements it is not possible, as long as you are not a builder, to build the track yourself. If you own the job as a builder, you get no perks, but just your normal salary.

## Construction:
The construction is usually limited to the time of one month. You may design the stations on your own, if desired. Each intermediate stop costs two tracks, each end station is also satisfied with one track only. Of course, the railway line can / should be connected to another existing station, if the space is sufficient, and the owner agrees. A multi-level station with different lines is also possible ;)

## Possession:
You are the owner of the railway line in your city area and your created station (in your territory). You have no right, if an intermediate station with further connections for example is built on "your" the railway line.
