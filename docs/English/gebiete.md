The server is divided into three zones:

## Farming Zone:
It is located in the west of the map. Everything is allowed here - except to protect areas.

## Transition zone:
This zone should be left untouched. It should only be crossed. If you're stuck there, you can free yourself from it, but the landscape should look untouched afterwards. It is 400 blocks wide, and between the two other zones.

## Build Zone:
Here you are allowed to build, and do any other activities that do not destroy the landscape. In the end, do not forget to protect your building with /protect (Areas). Also, you can take changes in the landscape, as long as it does not disturb anyone, and it looks nice again in the end;)
** Please respect the other players, and if they are still active (`/ last-login <player name>`) ask your neighbors if that's okay, if you want to do something extraordinary. ** Otherwise the map is big enough ;)
