Areas is a powerful mod with which you can regulate who is allowed to build in an area and who is not.

## Hints:
- If you want to protect an area below y = -50, then this must be agreed with the server team.
- Each player can secure 4 areas to a maximum size of 64x64x128. If you need more, please ask the server team.
- ** Only areas in the Build Zone can be protected. **

## Protecting the area:
- Craft some Markers (see in the Crafting Book for recipe)
- place the markers in the opposite corners, and then right-click one of them. Then you can protect your territory. It costs you nothing.

#### Or:
- `/area_pos1`,` /area_pos2`, `/protect <NameOfTheTerritory>`

## Add someone to your area:
- You can optionally define the area with the markers (not right-click them) in which the other player may build in your area. If you do not, then it is assumed that the player can access your entire area.
- `/add_owner <IdFromYourArea> <OtherPlayer> <NameTheNewArea>`

## Change owner:
- This can only be done by the "previous" qwner: `/change_owner <IdFromTheArea> <NewOwner>`

## Delete area:
`/remove_area <ID>`
