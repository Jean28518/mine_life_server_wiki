There are four jobs anyone can do. However, you can only change your job every 10 hours. If you have an idea for another job, let us know! You can actually sell all items except the month offer only with a special job to the Adminshop. You do not necessarily have to sell them to the adminshop because you can certainly sell your items to players for far better prices.
To see your current job, enter `/job info`

## Miner:
You're in a stuffy cave all the time, or in a mine shaft, digging your way through the world. Note that from a height of y = -100 you can no longer teleport to spawn using the / spawn command. That means you have to find your way back ;) That makes the job a bit more challenging. But it is also worth digging very deep, since from a height of about -2000 a few surprises will wait for you ;) (Little hint, from a height of y = -16000 you will see nothing new.) If once get down so deep, then the caves are more than a goldmine ;-)
`/job acquire miner`

## Farmer:
Who did not want to lead a beautiful life in the countryside? Here you can do it, and build it yourself! A few plants are worthwhile, a few rather less to sell them at the adminshop, make your own experience! In the beginning, it is highly recommended to save on the Mithril Scythe in the Adminshop as it greatly simplifies your work. In addition, it is worthwhile to build fields near railroad tracks, as there more often pass by players, and thus the field grows in time.
`/job acquire farmer`

## Builder:
Here you wander through the landscapes, and farm various resources to build. See in the Adminshop for the specific Items. With your abilities, of course, it makes more sense to go to construction jobs, because you may already have the materials ready, or at least the tricks know how to easily get to a particular item.
`/job acquire buider`

## Hunter:
Here you breed different animals and kill them. You can also sell the products again in the Adminshop. Of course, you can also sell them to other players, but probably the willingness to buy will probably not be that great in this case.
`/job acquire hunter`

## more jobs:
You can do these jobs in addition to the others, some of which are not yet implemented. But also from these jobs, you can only do one at one time. In addition, you should have already achieved something on the server;)

### Railway employees (not yet implemented):
They take care of everything, report bugs if necessary, and plan routes, stay in contact with the builders, and also get easier construction jobs when it comes to new routes, and they've been around for a long time.

### Flugschiff Vertrieb (not yet implemented):
You should teach the aspiring pilot ship pilots, take exams, and give licenses to them in the end.

### Policeman (not yet implemented):
As a police officer, you lock up people, take care of griefing cases, take care of law and order, check if people have bought tickets, and track down drug dealers.

### City Owner
You are the owner of a registered city where you can be the mayor. For more information, see the Cities article.

### Other:
There are also sometimes other special employees needed for certain things, these are posted on the job board next to the spawn. (By agreement, they can also run parallel to other "other" jobs.)

Of course in addition you can begin many jobs, wich are given by other player, as you want.
