Contracts are useful for making firm arrangements with players in game. For example, loans, property sales that take place in a city or your own contracts, such as employment contracts, would be suitable.

## All this must contain a contract:
- All contract partners
- A detailed description of the obligations of the contractors
- There is usually a perseon who gives the contract giver, and a contract taker. At least for the contract taker an exit clause should be formulated (if the obligations are not fulfilled).
- For services of all kinds, the contract expires after two months, and must be renewed.
- An inital date must also be in the contract.
- The title of the book describes the contract roughly, and there should also be the initial date in it!

## The sequence:
- One book is required per contract partner.
- Each contractor writes the contract in his book, and saves it.
- For a contract to be valid, each contractor must insert his own book in the contract letter box. You can find him in the building next to the spawn.
- Per /mail each contracting party gets feedback, whether the closed contract is valid, or not.
- You should probably only start with the terms and conditions, if the contract was confirmed by /mail ;)
