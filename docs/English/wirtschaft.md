The economy on the server should be an essential element, which is particularly taken into account.

## Currency:
There is the currency Minegeld, from which a player gets 250 in the beginning. For every Minetest Day a player actively plays on the server, he gets 10 coins, if there is room enough in his inventory.

## How do I earn the most money?
Basically, you have no limits. Do what you enjoy most! In the beginning, it makes sense to get a job on `/job`, and to farm / mine / mine related items, and to sell them in the adminshop. However, the items actually have a higher value. You can see the exact values ​​[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a7cTdIzLP7lu7MFUWDsL6GyTFIGALNxF3XbJCxzMcQo/edit#gid=0). That's why it makes more sense to sell your items in your own shops. The buyers are also happy because the items in the Adminshop are deliberately offered at much higher prices, and both thus take advantage of it ;) Is a particular item missing in the Adminshop? Or do you find a value in the table too low / too high? Feel free to write a message to the Server-Team!

Otherwise, look for jobs in the building next to the spawn, there can be quite a bit lucrative. In addition, there is an item per month, which you can sell for extra much money in the adminshop, which is always worthwhile;)

Otherwise, you could also start your own company, and offer certain services, or products. The team also likes to help you, if it does not require too much customization for the server ;)

## What do I do with my money?
Well, stupid, if you have too much money, right? You can, for example, set up your own city and apply for a railway line, buy an airship that is really fast, become a real estate marketer, and so on ... you have no limits;)

** It is strictly forbidden to sell services or goods to other players through real money or other services outside the server !!! **
